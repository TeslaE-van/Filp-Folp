[{"content":"When thinking about open source contributions, most people think about contributing code. This was true in the early days when open source was a way for people to share the cool thing they built.\nNow, as open source becomes the default way to build software, contributions required to create, manage, and sustain projects go beyond code.\nIn this article, you will learn how to make impactful contributions to open source that does not involve contributing code.\nWriting This might be an excellent way to contribute if you are good at technical writing and creating content.\nYou can use your writing skills in different ways.\nDocumentation People can\u0026rsquo;t use what they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nEven if the project is valuable, people would not be able to use it without proper documentation. Contributing to documentation can therefore be impactful.\nTip: When you first test out a project, go through the existing documentation and see if you can clearly understand and use the project without any issues.\nChances are you will find areas to improve. You can then open issues for it and fix them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s always helpful to have new people go through the documentation. It will uncover missing information and issues that people close to the project might miss.\nArticles and Tutorials If you are a project user, you can help by writing articles and tutorials. This can help people who are trying to use the project.\nYou can add your insights and tips and publish them on your channels or the project\u0026rsquo;s blog.\nTip: Most people look for well-written and up-to-date tutorials instead of documentation.\nInternationalization/Translation The language barrier is real in countries where English is not a primary language. People in China may prefer Mandarin over English.\nFor people from different parts of the world to use a project, it is necessary to internationalize the software and its documentation.\nIf you can write in two languages, you can translate documentation to open up the project to a new user base.\nSocial Media A social media presence can help a project get more users. It can also be a platform to share updates with existing users.\nYou can use your writing skills to craft social media posts. You can ask the project maintainers to post on their official account or use your own account.\nDesigning You can also contribute to open source projects with your design skills.\nArt Create artwork for social media, blog posts, and even swags. Good design is always impactful.\nStyle Guide Most open source projects have a large and geographically distributed set of contributors.\nAmong other challenges, this makes it difficult to maintain consistency in visual designs.\nAs a designer, you can create a style guide for the project and ensure consistency.\nTesting/Using You can make valuable contributions in multiple ways as an open source user.\nReporting Bugs Be a needy user. If you run into bugs, raise them. Open an issue with all the relevant details and steps to reproduce it.\nIdentifying bugs is more difficult than fixing them. Maintainers always welcome bug reports.\nAdvocating Open source projects are community driven. And most non-commercial open source projects don\u0026rsquo;t have a dedicated marketing team to publicize the project.\nYou can advocate for the project at events and on social media and encourage people to use the project.\nTip: Don\u0026rsquo;t even ask the project owners before advocating for the project. Everyone likes free marketing.\nUser Experience Project maintainers can often be too close to the project to realize bad and unintuitive UX. I am, and I know a lot of them.\nAs a user, you can report these issues, and they are well received.\nAlpha/Beta Testing Alpha/Beta tests are controlled tests of a new feature or release to ensure quality and user experience before making it available to the general user base.\nAs a user, you can sign up for the alpha/beta programs, test the project before the new features are released, and provide feedback.\nFeedback from these tests always provides insights that can help improve the features/releases.\nCommunity Managing An open source project is a byproduct of its community. But who builds and manages these communities?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where a community manager comes in. As a community manager, you can wear different hats.\nProject Organiser Stale issues? Follow up! Issues without proper labels? Add them! Does this issue still exist? Verify and close them! Unclear issue descriptions? Ask for clarification! Unreviewed pull requests? Request for reviews!\nAll these help the project run smoothly.\nRelease Manager A release manager keeps track of what everybody is working on and ensures that a project is ready for a release.\nSome of the responsibilities of a release manager are:\n Checking with each team Ensuring different components and features are tested Organizing the alpha/beta programs  Event Organizer Organize community events and project meetings and maybe represent the project at conferences.\nGreat community managers who go above and beyond are key players in the success of an open source project.\nMentoring If you are a seasoned contributor, you can pay it forward to the community by being a mentor.\nCode Review Having more people review code can help improve the quality of the code. This means fewer bugs, faster reviews, and a better project.\nMost projects allow anyone to review code.\nHelping Newcomers Sharing your skills and experience as a contributor can help newcomers contribute to the project. There are a lot of open source mentorship programs that connect mentees to mentors.\nHaving new contributors will ensure the sustainability of the project.\n This list is not exhaustive and you can always find more ways to make impactful contributions.\nAs an open source maintainer, I see the value in every contribution. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure more maintainers see it too.\nIf you found this helpful, checkout related posts .\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/non-code-contributions-to-open-source/","summary":"As open source becomes the default way to build software, contributions required to create, manage, and sustain projects go beyond code.

This tutorial uses minikube for creating a cluster. Install and configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster. Install Helm to deploy the APISIX Ingress controller.  Deploying a Sample Application We will use a sample HTTP server application (bare-minimum-api ) to demonstrate the working of the Ingress controller.\nWhile running the application, you can set a \u0026ldquo;version\u0026rdquo; and a port to listen to. For this example, we will create two \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; of this application which will return different responses as shown below:\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- |:8080/ GET| a1(bare-minimum-api-v1) a1 -- |Hello from API v1.0!| c c -- |:8081/ GET| a2(bare-minimum-api-v2) a2 -- |Hello from API v2.0!| c  You can deploy the application on your Kubernetes cluster by running:\nkubectl run bare-minimum-api-v1 --image navendup/bare-minimum-api --port 8080 -- 8080 v1.0 kubectl expose pod bare-minimum-api-v1 --port 8080 To test the application outside the cluster, you can use port-forward:\nkubectl port-forward bare-minimum-api-v1 8080:8080 Now, if you open up a new terminal window and run:\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:8080 You will get back a response from the application:\nHello from API v1.0! Similarly, you can deploy another \u0026ldquo;version\u0026rdquo; of the application by running:\nkubectl run bare-minimum-api-v2 --image navendup/bare-minimum-api --port 8081 -- 8081 v2.0 kubectl expose pod bare-minimum-api-v2 --port 8081 Now, we can deploy APISIX Ingress and expose these applications to external traffic.\nDeploying APISIX Ingress APISIX and APISIX Ingress controller can be installed using Helm:\nhelm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm repo update kubectl create ns ingress-apisix helm install apisix apisix/apisix \\  --set gateway.type=NodePort \\  --set ingress-controller.enabled=true \\  --namespace ingress-apisix \\  --set ingress-controller.config.apisix.serviceNamespace=ingress-apisix kubectl get pods --namespace ingress-apisix  Note: We are using NodePort as the Gateway service type. You can also set it to LoadBalancer if your cluster has one.\n Helm will create five resources in your cluster:\n apisix-gateway: The data plane that handles external traffic. apisix-admin: Control plane that processes configuration changes. apisix-ingress-controller: The ingress controller. apisix-etcd and 5. apisix-etcd headless: To store configuration and handle internal communication.  Once all the pods and services are running, you can test APISIX by accessing the Admin API:\nkubectl exec -n ingress-apisix deploy/apisix -- curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes -H \u0026#39;X-API-Key: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\u0026#39; If you get a response similar to the one shown below, APISIX is up and running:\n{ \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;get\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/apisix/routes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dir\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;nodes\u0026#34;: [] }, \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 0 } Configuring APISIX Ingress Once you have verified that the APISIX gateway and Ingress controller is running, you can create Routes to expose the deployed application to external traffic.\nThis will route traffic between the two application versions based on the client request:\nflowchart LR c(Client)  |\"Req: /v1 GET\\nResp: Hello from API v1.0!\"| a a -- |Route| s1(\"☸ bare-minimum-api-v1\") a -- s2(\"☸ bare-minimum-api-v2\") ic(\"☸ APISIX Ingress controller\") --- p(\"☸ APISIX API gateway\") style p stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 0 stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 1 stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 3 stroke: #e62129 subgraph k[\"☸ Kubernetes cluster\"] a s1 s2 end subgraph a[\"APISIX\"] direction TB ic p end  flowchart LR c(Client)  |\"Req: /v2 GET\\nResp: Hello from API v2.0!\"| a a -- s1(\"☸ bare-minimum-api-v1\") a -- |Route| s2(\"☸ bare-minimum-api-v2\") ic(\"☸ APISIX Ingress controller\") --- p(\"☸ APISIX API gateway\") style p stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 0 stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 2 stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 3 stroke: #e62129 subgraph k[\"☸ Kubernetes cluster\"] a s1 s2 end subgraph a[\"APISIX\"] direction TB ic p end  To configure Routes, APISIX comes with declarative and easy-to-use custom resource :\napiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2beta3 kind: ApisixRoute metadata: name: api-routes spec: http: - name: route-1 match: hosts: - local.navendu.me paths: - /v1 backends: - serviceName: bare-minimum-api-v1 servicePort: 8080 - name: route-2 match: hosts: - local.navendu.me paths: - /v2 backends: - serviceName: bare-minimum-api-v2 servicePort: 8081 The APISIX Ingress controller converts this resource to an APISIX gateway configuration.\nAPISIX also supports configuration using native Kubernetes Ingress resource :\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: api-routes spec: ingressClassName: apisix rules: - host: local.navendu.me http: paths: - backend: service: name: bare-minimum-api-v1 port: number: 8080 path: /v1 pathType: Exact - backend: service: name: bare-minimum-api-v2 port: number: 8081 path: /v2 pathType: Exact You can use either to configure APISIX but I prefer the easier APISIX custom resource. We can apply this manifest file to our cluster to create Routes in APISIX:\nkubectl apply -f apisix-ingress-manifest.yaml If the Ingress controller is configured correctly, you should see a response indicating that APISIX API gateway has been configured:\napisixroute.apisix.apache.org/api-routes created Now, let\u0026rsquo;s test these Routes.\nTesting the Created Routes If you were following along using minikube and NodePort, you should be able to access APISIX through the Node IP of the service apisix-gateway. If the Node IP is not reachable directly (if you are on Darwin, Windows, or WSL), you can create a tunnel to access the service on your machine:\nminikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix This will show the URL with which you can access the apisix-gateway service.\nYou can send a GET request to this URL and it would be Routed to the appropriate service:\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:51538/v2 -H \u0026#39;host:local.navendu.me\u0026#39; Hello from API v2.0! Now you have APISIX routing traffic to your applications! You can try the two configured Routes and see APISIX routing the requests to the appropriate application.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? In this tutorial, you learned to set up APISIX Ingress on your cluster. We tested it out by configuring basic Routes to a sample application.\nWith APISIX gateway and the Ingress controller, you can also configure Upstreams, Plugins, mTLS, and monitoring.

I had no work experience as a software engineer, but I was determined to learn by contributing to open source projects.\nBut which project do I contribute to? Where do I start? What if I\u0026rsquo;m not skilled enough?\nAs I sat puzzled by these questions, I stumbled across the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program .\nThe LFX Mentorship Program provides opportunities for mentees to work on open source projects. Experienced project contributors and maintainers will be the program\u0026rsquo;s mentors. Mentees will also receive a stipend during their term in the program.\nI got selected as a mentee, received a full-time offer after the program, and returned to the program as a mentor.\nToday, I work in open source full-time.\nIn this article, I will share how I got involved in the LFX Mentorship Program and its life-changing impact on my career and personal life.\nStumble Beginnings After learning about the program on YouTube, I landed on the LFX Mentorship homepage . There, I found the answers to my questions.\nI found the list of open source projects participating in the program. It showed me what the project is about, what skills they expect mentees to have, and everything else I need to get started.\nI got interested in the Meshery project and joined its community. There were many helpful people there, and I started making small contributions. In a couple of months, I was learning new skills and making more impactful contributions.\nI applied to be an LFX mentee for the project and was accepted. I was already contributing to the project, and being part of the program was a bonus.\n My LFX mentee profileI applied to three projects but did not try to work on the other two. Here\u0026rsquo;s my profile\n  Levelling Up During the program, I developed skills to work on cloud native technologies. I learned to program in Go, built applications on Docker and Kubernetes and learned more about the ecosystem.\nI also improved my communication skills by working in a global, async team. I was writing design specifications, user-facing documentation, and blog posts.\nThe program also opened a lot of opportunities to speak at international conferences, work with maintainers from top tech companies, and interact with other open source communities.\nI gained the confidence to contribute to open source projects. Maybe it can be my career!\nFull-Time Open Sourcerer Making me realize that contributing to open source projects can be a career option was the most significant impact the LFX Mentorship Program had on me.\nAfter the program, I received a job offer to work on Meshery and related projects.\n🧙‍♂️ Getting paid to work on open source projects was (and is) the best. To this date, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I\u0026rsquo;m working at all. I\u0026rsquo;m doing things I like to do, and apparently, someone thinks it\u0026rsquo;s worth paying me for it.\nPaying it Forward The open source community is about paying it forward.\nWhen I started as an open source contributor, a lot of people helped me. They answered my noob questions, corrected mistakes in my code, and guided me through projects and communities.\nSo, after being promoted to an open source maintainer, I joined back in the LFX Mentorship Program. This time, as a mentor.\n My LFX mentor profileYou can see the transition on my profile\n  I learned a lot by being a mentor. I developed skills as a leader, and it opened up more career opportunities.\nLFX, the Catalyst The effect programs like LFX have on the open source ecosystem is monumental. As open source becomes the default way to build software, these programs help foster contributions from an ever-growing set of newcomers. And contributions from these newcomers ensure sustainability.\nOn the surface, the LFX Mentorship Program can look like any other internship program. But for someone without access to such opportunities because of where they are in the world, the program is highly impactful.\nAnd based on the stats, more people are applying to the program and actively participating in open source. This, in turn, drives organizations to make more of their code free and open source.\nSo, apply to the program if you are interested in contributing to open source, especially if you are a student. If you are a seasoned contributor, participate as a mentor and pay it forward.\nYou can also check out other programs like LFX in 20\u0026#43; Open Source Internship Programs that you can Apply to .\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-the-lfx-mentorship-program-helped-me-level-up-my-career/","summary":"Sharing how I got involved in the LFX Mentorship Program and its life-changing impact on my career and personal life.","title":"How the LFX Mentorship Program Helped Me Level-Up My Career"},{"content":"As your APIs scale, the need for making them reliable and robust increases.\nThis article discusses the best practices for building reliable APIs by introducing a special kind of reverse proxies called API gateways.\nWe will look into:\n Problems with traditional API designs What API gateways are How API gateways improve APIs and Patterns and examples using API gateways  But first, what are \u0026ldquo;reliable\u0026rdquo; APIs?\nWhat Makes an API Reliable? As a service provider, you might have service-level agreements (SLAs) with your customers, usually quoted in uptime—the amount of time the service is guaranteed to be online and operational.\nUptime is a myopic view of reliability. To understand what it means to be reliable, you have to look at the factors that affect uptime. Once you understand these factors, you will be in a better position to build reliable services.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at these factors and the questions they pose:\n Latency: How fast does your API respond to requests? Security: Who can access your API? Is it secure? Downtime Frequency: How frequently is your API down? Consistency: Are your API endpoints constant? Do consumers need to change their code often? Monitoring and Reporting: Can you observe issues and failures in your API? Are you reporting them to your consumers?  flowchart LR c1(Web App) -- |Consistency| m1(Service 1) c1 -- m2(Service 2) c2(iOS App) -- |Latency| m1 c2 -- |Downtime| m3(Service 3) c2 -- m4(Service 4) c3(Android App) -- |Security| m2 c3 -- |Monitoring| m4 subgraph Clients c1 c2 c3 end subgraph API m1 m2 m3 m4 end  As organizations move to cloud native architectures, it becomes difficult for the development teams to account for these factors on each of their services. And as these systems scale, it would be much easier to delegate these responsibilities to a single, separate system. Say hello to API gateways!\nAPI Gateway, the Unified Entrypoint An API gateway acts as a middleman between your clients and your APIs. It will accept all traffic (API calls) like reverse proxies, forwards the request to the required services in your backend, and returns the needed results.\nflowchart LR c1(Web App) --- ag(API Gateway) c2(iOS App) --- ag c3(Android App) --- ag ag --- m1(Service 1) ag --- m2(Service 2) ag --- m3(Service 3) ag --- m4(Service 4) style ag stroke: #e62129 subgraph Clients c1 c2 c3 end subgraph API m1 m2 m3 m4 end  An API gateway can be the central point that handles all the authentication, security, traffic control, and monitoring concerns, leaving the API developers to focus on business needs and making it easier to improve reliability.\nflowchart LR subgraph ag[API Gateway] f1(Authentication, Security, Monitoring, Traffic Control) end c(Client) -- f1 -- a(API/Upstream)  There are a lot of open source and managed API gateway offerings available. In this article, I will be using Apache APISIX .\nThe following section will describe some of the best practices to make your APIs reliable using API gateways.\nReliability Best Practices with API Gateways We will focus more on the pattern underneath than the actual implementation, as it can vary based on your API gateway choice.\nI will divide these patterns into three categories:\n Authentication and security Monitoring and observability Version control and zero downtime  We will look into each category in detail below.\nAuthentication and Security User Authentication Authenticated requests with API gateways secure client-API interactions. After a client authenticates, your API gateway can use the obtained client details for fine-grained control.\nflowchart LR u(\"👤 User\") -- ag(API Gateway) -- |User Info| s1(Service 1) \u0026 s2(Service 2) \u0026 s3(Service 3) style ag stroke: #e62129  APISIX handles authentication directly through plugins like key-auth and jwt-auth . APISIX also supports OAuth authentication and role-based access control systems like wolf through plugins like openid-connect and wolf-rbac , respectively.\nRate Limiting Intentional (DoS attacks) and unintentional (clients making too many requests) traffic spikes to your APIs can bring them down like a house of cards. Setting up rate limiting will improve the reliability of your systems in handling such scenarios.\nYou can set up rate limiting on your API gateway, and if the number of requests increases above a threshold, the API gateway could either delay or reject the exceeding requests.\nflowchart LR START1[ ] -- rd{  Threshold ? } -- r(Router) -- u(Upstream/API) START2[ ] -- rd -- r START3[ ] -- rd ---x |Reject/Delay| r START4[ ] -- rd ---x |Reject/Delay| r style START1 height:0px style START2 height:0px style START3 height:0px style START4 height:0px linkStyle 1 stroke:green linkStyle 4 stroke:green linkStyle 6 stroke:red linkStyle 8 stroke:red subgraph ag[ API Gateway] r rd end  With APISIX, you can use any of the three plugins to configure rate limits based on number of requests, number of concurrent requests per client, and count (limit-req , limit-conn , limit-count ).\nMonitoring and Observability Your API\u0026rsquo;s reliability and your monitoring setup go hand in hand. You can monitor your reliability metrics by setting up monitoring on your API gateway.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- ag -- u(Upstream/API) subgraph ag[API Gateway] mo(\"🔍 Tracers, 📃 Loggers, and 📈 Metrics\") end  API logs and traces provide detailed information about an API call. This information will help you know when your API has failed or has an error as soon as possible. Silent fails lead to unfixed errors which can cause problems in the future.\nWith some configuration, you will also be able to predict and anticipate traffic for the future, helping you scale reliably.\nAPISIX has plugins that integrate with logging (Apache SkyWalking , RocketMQ ), metrics (Prometheus , Datadog ), and tracing (OpenTelemetry , Zipkin ) platforms/specifications. You can read more on API Observability with APISIX Plugins .\nVersion Control and Zero Downtime Canary Release When switching to new versions of your APIs, you must ensure that you don\u0026rsquo;t drop your traffic. Clients should still be able to make requests to your API and get back the correct response.\nWith an API gateway, you can setup canary releases. This will ensure that your API remains functional during the transition, and you can also roll back to the older version if there are any issues.\nInitially, the API gateway will route all traffic to your API\u0026rsquo;s old version.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- ag(API Gateway) -- |All Traffic| u1(Upstream v1.0) ag x-.-x |No Traffic| u2(Upstream v2.0) style ag stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 1 stroke: green subgraph u[Upstream/API] u1 u2 end  When you have a new version, you can configure the API gateway to route some of your traffic to this new version. You can keep increasing the percentage of traffic to your new service and check if everything is working as expected.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- ag(API Gateway) -- |Most Traffic 95%| u1(Upstream v1.0) ag -- |Some Traffic 5%| u2(Upstream v2.0) style ag stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 1 stroke: green linkStyle 2 stroke: green subgraph u[Upstream/API] u1 u2 end  Finally, you can route all traffic to your new API.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- ag(API Gateway) x-.-x |No Traffic| u1(Upstream v1.0) ag -- |All Traffic| u2(Upstream v2.0) style ag stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 2 stroke: green subgraph u[Upstream/API] u1 u2 end  APISIX uses the traffic-split plugin that lets you control the traffic to your services. You can use it to set up canary releases or your custom release configuration.\nCircuit Breaking When one of your upstream services is unavailable or is experiencing high latency, it needs to be cut off from your system. Otherwise, the client will keep retrying the request, leading to resource exhaustion. This failure can creep into other services in your system and bring them down.\nLike how electrical circuit breakers isolate faulty components from a circuit, API gateways have a circuit breaker feature that disconnects faulty services, keeping the system healthy. Traffic to these services are rerouted or delayed until the service becomes healthy.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- ag(API Gateway) x-.-x |\"⚡ Break\"| u1(Upstream A 1) ag -- u2(Upstream A 2) ag -- u3(Upstream A 3) style ag stroke: #e62129 style u1 stroke: red linkStyle 1 stroke: red subgraph u[Upstream/API] u1 u2 u3 end  APISIX comes with an api-breaker plugin that implements this pattern.\nRedirects As you update your APIs, their endpoints might undergo some change. Traditionally, this would mean that the client application should send requests to the /new-api-endpoint instead of the /old-api-endpoint, meaning your consumers must manually change each call to this API endpoint.\nIf unanticipated, this can break client applications.\nWith an API gateway, you can provide an abstraction layer and redirect requests to the /new-api-endpoint without having the clients change their requests. With proper redirect status codes and messages, you can gradually depreciate the /old-api-endpoint without your consumers experiencing any downtime.\nflowchart LR c(Clients) -- |/old-api-endpoint| ag(API Gateway) ag -- |\"3xx: 'Depreciation notice'\"| c ag x-.-x u1(/old-api-endpoint) ag --- |Redirect| u2(/new-api-endpoint) style ag stroke: #e62129 linkStyle 2 stroke: grey subgraph u[Upstream/API] u1 u2 end  With APISIX, you can use the redirect plugin to configure redirects.\nConclusion When reliability becomes a primary concern, it is evident that API gateways are necessary as more organizations split their monoliths into microservices and move to cloud native architectures.\nHowever, this does not mean API gateways are for everyone. Depending on your API\u0026rsquo;s size and usage, an API gateway might be overkill, and you can get away with using a reverse proxy with basic routing and load balancing capabilities.\nThe use cases mentioned here only scratch the surface of an API gateway\u0026rsquo;s capabilities.

This year, I have been trying to improve how I ask questions. Here is how I do it.\nBut first of all,\nWhat are Good Questions? Good questions are the ones that are easy to answer.\nOur goal for asking a question is to have the other person explain what they know in a way you can understand. A series of good questions is the key to a good answer.\nBad:\n J: What happens when we strip the binaries? (Too vague and broad)\nN: Stripped binaries don’t have debugging information. So its size is reduced \u0026hellip; (Answers with a lot of irrelevant information)\n Good:\n J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce their size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have? (Clear question, easy to answer)\n  N: Stripping only removes the debugging information. It wouldn’t affect the performance in any way. But it will be difficult to debug if we run into any issues as debug symbols are removed from the traceback.\n The Problem with Bad Questions Bad questions can derail a conversation quickly.\nFor me, asking bad questions has often resulted in:\n  the person explaining things irrelevant to my question.\n  the person explaining things I have no clue of.\n  the person explaining what I already know.\n  the person not answering the question at all (especially for under-researched questions).\n  All of this boils down to you or both of you walking away frustrated and without a clear answer.\nAt this point, it should be obvious why you should focus on asking questions properly. So, here is my process.\nWho are you Asking? Who you are asking a question should impact how you ask the question. Let me explain.\nIf you are asking your coworker who works on your project or is familiar with the particular niche, you can reasonably assume that the person has some context on what you are asking.\nThis means there would be fewer things to explain, and you can build your explanation from your shared knowledge. But it is a different game when you are asking questions to the people of the interwebs.\nWhen I began programming, I had my share of bashing from people in Stack Overflow. I get that having a high bar for quality assurance helps Stack Overflow be the go-to place to ask questions, but some of the moderators are so trigger-happy that they will shoot you (your question) down right away.\nBut anyway, the important thing to remember here is that the person reading your question has very little context about your situation. It is obvious when a person has put little to no effort into the question, and these questions are the first to get the bashing.\nWhen to Ask? If you have a lot of questions or if you think answering your question will take time, it is better to schedule a time when you are both available.\nIf your questions are quick, it is better to ask them right away if it saves you a lot of time.\nGoogle First, Ask Later One of my biggest pet peeves is people who ask technical questions that can be answered by the first result of a Google search. It shows little effort on their part, and now I just ask people to Google it and do not bother to answer until they do their homework.\n I maintain a project called Meshery, and one of the new contributors (who came in to get a GSoC internship ) literally asked if I could explain what Meshery is.\nWe have a website, 100+ pages of documentation, recordings of conference talks, and technical documentation, all sent to the user as they join the community.\nYou know how that conversation went.\nIt would have been different if they had asked me something like, “I have been going through Meshery’s docs and been trying it out locally. I’m unclear how Meshery adds value if a person already uses a service mesh. Could you point me to any docs where this is explained better?”.\nThink for a moment about how you would have answered in these scenarios.\n Doing a bit of research can help you build some foundational knowledge to ask a set of better questions.\nThe “Google first, ask later” motto is only good as a rule of thumb. Nothing has stopped me from asking obvious, googleable (it is a real word ) questions when in conversation with someone.\nTo sum it up, make some effort, do your homework, and then ask your questions. Don’t expect to be spoon-fed.\nIs that Right? Let’s go back to the “stripped binary” example.\n J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce their size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have?\n See how stating what you already know lets you build the rest of the conversation.\nTo ask this question, you must spend some time digging through what a stripped binary is and how it is different from a “normal” binary. The time taken to understand and formulate that question is time well spent.\nOn the receiving end, the person will see that you have spent time in this and are not just asking them to do your work. It will also be easier to answer your question by building on your foundational knowledge.\nVague Precise Questions  J: How do I use a Kind cluster to set up my development environment?\n If you ask me this, I would reply with a link to the Kind docs. But this wasn’t what they intended to ask. So they say,\n J: I tried this, but it is not working.\n Well, there are million different reasons for this not to work. I am not Doctor Strange to evaluate all the possibilities in a second! A little bit more context might help.\nI will cut to the chase and say how I would ask this question.\n N: I was trying to set up Kind for my local development environment. I am on macOS. I have Docker Desktop and Kind running. I also have set up Metallb LoadBalancer, and I see the external IP of the service, as shown on the logs below. Still, I am not able to reach it from my host machine. Is there something I’m missing?\n Then that senior engineer with years of experience can jump right in and say,\n S: On macOS, Docker does not expose the docker network to the host. You can try port-forwarding to reach the pods.\n See how easy it was to answer?\nThis goes for all questions. The more precise you are with your questions, the easier it is to answer.\nThis also prevents the person answering from going off on a tangent, explaining irrelevant details that you may either not care about or aren’t relevant to your actual question.\nAnother way to prevent shooting off on a tangent is to ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes/no.\n J: Why are we using this gRPC middleware instead of directly calling the required service?\n    J: Are we using this gRPC middleware to convert between two different configuration formats?\n  N: Yes.\n The person usually goes to explain why yes/no after this, but these questions are easy to answer, and I almost always get quick responses.\nThese questions are pretty helpful when you are in conversation with a person, and they are explaining something to you. This segues into my next point.\nWhen in Doubt, Ask More Questions Imposter syndrome is real.\nWhen I started working with others, I often stopped myself from saying, “I don’t understand”, thinking I would look stupid.\nI have then come to learn that if you ask a “stupid” question, you are stupid for the day, but if you don’t, you are stupid for life (because you will always stop yourself from asking questions, ending up not understanding things completely\u0026hellip; umm, you get it right?).\nThis means when you get an answer, and you are not completely satisfied,\n  say what you don’t understand.\n  ask more clarifying questions.\n  stop the speaker and ask more specific questions.\n  Confronting the imposter syndrome is hard, but it has been helpful to me in knowing that everyone else faces this too .\nWhen you start thinking, “maybe I’m just not smart enough to understand the answer”, remember that people want to help you. You just have to help them help you!\nLearning in Public Ask questions in a public channel instead of DMs.\nThis may not work in every situation, but I try to do this more often now.\nThis will document the discussions publicly and would also help any others looking in. You can always point people to this discussion if they ask the same question.\nTake Stack Overflow, for example. You almost always find answers to problems you face from questions someone else asks.\nThe imposter syndrome shifts to the next gear here. Face it head-on.\nAsking Good Questions is a Skill And like all skills, it is sharpened with practice.\nAsking the right questions will help you extract the answers you want. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you are not asking the right questions.\nI have improved over the year and am still working out the kinks in my process.\nThis might be a good post to come back to in a year to reflect on and improve.\nTo summarise this post in a sentence,\nMake it easy for people to help you.\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-i-ask-questions/","summary":"I ask a lot of questions to my peers and to strangers on public forums in the internet.

But I often had to modify these diagrams when I made a mistake or when they were outdated. Maintaining these diagrams consumed a lot of my time and effort. There has to be a better way, right?\nI was writing a new blog post with many diagrams when I googled \u0026ldquo;diagrams in markdown\u0026rdquo; and found Mermaid .\nMermaid lets you create diagrams by writing text in markdown files. It has an intuitive syntax and verbose documentation to help you make diagrams quickly.\nIt is also easy to add Mermaid to your Hugo blog. You can use shortcodes to add your diagrams in Mermaid syntax and have them rendered on your blog posts.\nflowchart TB y(\u0026quot;👫 You\u0026quot;) --\u0026gt; s{Subscribed to navendu.me?} s --\u0026gt; |Yes| a(\u0026quot;🥳 You are awesome!\u0026quot;) s --\u0026gt; |No| su[/\u0026quot;Subscribe to navendu.me\u0026quot;/] --\u0026gt; a click su href \u0026quot;/subscribe\u0026quot; _blank flowchart TB y(\"👫 You\") -- s{Subscribed to navendu.me?} s -- |Yes| a(\"🥳 You are awesome!\") s -- |No| su[/\"Subscribe to navendu.me\"/] -- a click su href \"/subscribe\" _blank  Check out the official documentation to learn more about Mermaid and its syntax.\nThis article will look at how you can add Mermaid to your Hugo blog.\nImport and Configure Mermaid The first step is to import Mermaid. The simplest way to do this is by importing the minified file from a CDN.\nCreate a file mermaid.html in your layouts/partials directory. We will import and configure Mermaid here.\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;application/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var config = { startOnLoad: true, theme:\u0026#39;{{ if site.Params.mermaid.theme }}{{ site.Params.mermaid.theme }}{{ else }}dark{{ end }}\u0026#39;, align:\u0026#39;{{ if site.Params.mermaid.align }}{{ site.Params.mermaid.align }}{{ else }}center{{ end }}\u0026#39;,  }; mermaid.initialize(config); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The highlighted line looks for parameters in your site\u0026rsquo;s configuration file (config.yaml). This makes it easy to change Mermaid\u0026rsquo;s theme and alignment.\nYou can look for more configuration options in Mermaid docs. I only have these two configurations now and can add them to my site\u0026rsquo;s configuration file.\nparams: mermaid: theme: \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34; align: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34; Loading Mermaid on Required Pages It is unnecessary to load Mermaid on every page in your blog. You only need it on pages where there are Mermaid diagrams.\nWe will only add the layouts/partials/mermaid.html file when a page needs it. To set this up, we will create a front matter variable mermaid, which can be set to true to load Mermaid.\nNow, in your page layout, you can check if this variable is set and load the mermaid.html partial file. My page layout file is layouts/_default/single.html.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;post-content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- if not (.Param \u0026#34;disableAnchoredHeadings\u0026#34;) }} {{- partial \u0026#34;anchored_headings.html\u0026#34; .Content -}} {{- else }}{{ .Content }}{{ end }} \u0026lt;!-- Add mermaid min js file --\u0026gt; {{ if (.Params.mermaid) }} {{ partial \u0026#34;mermaid.html\u0026#34; }} {{ end }}  {{ partial \u0026#34;subscribe.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; You can now import Mermaid by setting the mermaid page variable to true in your markdown files as shown below:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Adding Diagrams to Your Hugo Blog With Mermaid\u0026#34; date: 2022-08-26T15:46:16+05:30 draft: true weight: 14 ShowToc: true TocOpen: true mermaid: true summary: \u0026#34;This article shows how you can add diagrams to your Hugo site with Mermaid.\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mermaid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blogs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tutorials\u0026#34;] Creating the mermaid Shortcode The final step is to create a shortcode to add diagrams in Mermaid syntax to your markdown files.\nCreate a new file layouts/shortcodes/mermaid.html with the below content:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;mermaid\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Inner}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; That\u0026rsquo;s it!

I spent a little more than an hour yesterday migrating it from GitHub Pages to Netlify.\nGitHub Pages is a perfect solution for deploying static websites. But, it made it challenging to implement some of the features I wanted on my blog.\nSo, on impulse and to procrastinate from finishing a blog post, I migrated the site to Netlify!\nWhat GitHub Pages Lacked GitHub Pages has been my go-to static website deployment solution for the past three years. And it worked like a charm even if it was free.\nI have been looking for ways to set up my Hugo website to show draft blog posts. The problem was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want these drafts to show up on the homepage listing, but I also wanted a sharable link for people to review.\nThere are ways I can set this up, but even if I do that, there aren\u0026rsquo;t any ways for people/reviewers to leave feedback on my static website.\nI also used a lot of client-side redirects, which is not desirable as opposed to server-side redirects. GitHub Pages did not provide a way for you to configure server-side redirects. So I had to use these hacky, Jekyll redirects on a subdomain. It works, but it could be better.\nEnter Netlify Netlify has deploy previews . So, when you make a pull request to your production branch, Netlify will build the site for you and show a preview of what the change will look like.\n Deploy preview feature in NetlifyFrom github.com/navendu-pottekkat\n  You know what this is best for? Previewing draft blog posts!\nUsing Netlify, I can open a pull request with my draft post, and Netlify will generate a preview build of the site without affecting my production site. Reviewers can see the preview and suggest edits as comments on GitHub.\nNetlify also brings a better continuous integration experience.\n CI checks run by NetlifyFrom github.com/navendu-pottekkat\n  Netlify lets you configure the build settings through the Netlify UI or a configuration file (netlify.toml). This gives you a lot more control than the few configuration options GitHub Pages provides.\n Netlify dashboard for navendu.meI added a Plugin and to lint links and it broke the CI because there were a lot of broken links. Task for another day.\n  With Netlify, configuring redirects is as easy as adding two lines to your configuration file. You also have the option to configure the proper status code. Now that\u0026rsquo;s neat.\nNetlify also has a DNS service, supports storing large media (Git LFS), has split testing and rollback features, and more . But, these are only \u0026ldquo;nice to have\u0026rdquo; features for me now. I will not be using these anytime soon*.\n * I might use these sometime soon.\n How I Migrated to Netlify The process was pretty straightforward. It only took me a little over an hour to set everything up and test.\nIn the steps below, I have the following setup:\n A Hugo blog published on GitHub Pages. A custom domain registered on Hostgator (also my DNS service).  You can always refer to the official Netlify docs if you have a different setup somewhere along this guide.\nCreate a Netlify Account First, you must create a Netlify account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one.\n Create your Netlify accountDo you also use GitHub for everything?\n  Import Your Website You can now add your website to Netlify. You should have the code for your website on a Git provider. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, now is the time to git push your code.\n  Click on \u0026ldquo;Add new site\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Import project\u0026rdquo;.\n Importing your site     Select the Git provider where you have your website code.\n Select your provider     Pick the repository from the Git provider after granting access to Netlify.\n Pick the repository to deploy     You can then configure the build settings based on your blog engine. Since I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo, I will add the following configurations.\n Build settings for my Hugo website--gc cleans up old resources, --minify reduces the size of the files and the public folder is where Hugo outputs the build\n    And voila! Netlify will automatically build your first deployment. Now, you will be able to see the production URL for your website.\n Production URL of your websiteThis screenshot is from Netlify\u0026rsquo;s docs\n  This URL is unique; you can change it to yoursitename.netlify.app or your custom domain.\nChanging the Website URL and Custom Domains You can change your site URL to anything unique. Once changed, this will be your website\u0026rsquo;s address.\n  From the \u0026ldquo;Site overview\u0026rdquo; page, Go to \u0026ldquo;Domain settings\u0026rdquo;.\n  Click on the \u0026ldquo;Options\u0026rdquo; next to the site name and click \u0026ldquo;Edit site name\u0026rdquo;.\n Edit the generated site namekung-fu-panda-23 is a cool name\n    Change the site name and save.\n   Note: If you use this URL, you might need to change the baseURL in your Hugo configuration file to ensure all the links work.\n In my setup, I\u0026rsquo;m using Hostgator as my DNS service and not the Netlify DNS service.\n  In \u0026ldquo;Domain settings\u0026rdquo;, click \u0026ldquo;Add custom domain\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can enter the domain you already own or enter something new and purchase the domain. Netlify will set everything up if you are buying a domain.\n  If you are using a domain you already own with an external DNS provider, you will see a warning. You can ignore that and click on \u0026ldquo;Add domain\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can also set up an SSL certificate from the HTTPS section.\n Secure your site with an SSL certificate     If you use a different DNS service, you need to configure it to point your domain to your Netlify website. You can check the Netlify docs if you have a different setup than mine.\n Login to your domain\u0026rsquo;s control panel and open up your DNS configuration. I\u0026rsquo;m using Hostgator for my domain. Create an A Record with your apex domain and point it to Netlify\u0026rsquo;s load balancer IP address 75.2.60.5. Then, create a CNAME record for the wwwsubdomain and point it to your website address yoursitename.netlify.app.  Now, you must wait for the changes to propagate, and you will have your domain configured.\nConfiguring Deploy Previews The main reason to migrate was the deploy previews feature. And it is super easy to set up.\n Go to \u0026ldquo;Site settings\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Build \u0026amp; deploy\u0026rdquo; from the side menu and then \u0026ldquo;Continuous Deployment\u0026rdquo;. Scroll down to \u0026ldquo;Deploy previews\u0026rdquo; and set it up as desired. I have enabled it for any pull request against my production branch, and I have also enabled the Netlify Drawer.  That is it. You now have deploy previews!\n Note: To ensure that the deploy previews show drafts, I updated my Netlify configuration file (netlify.toml) to change the build command for deploy previews.\n[context.deploy-preview] command = \u0026#34;hugo --buildFuture --buildDrafts --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\u0026#34; Here $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL is an environment variable that Netlify sets, used to update the site\u0026rsquo;s baseURL.\n That brings an end to my current setup. It is much better than my earlier setup with GitHub Pages and was pretty easy to migrate. I would definitely recommend Netlify for your static websites.\nFeatures I Might Add in the Future This was my first iteration with Netlify. I have a basic setup that more or less does everything I need. But, I might use these other features if they are fruitful.\nForm Handling I use Mailchimp to handle subscriptions to this blog. If I can find a way to send mass emails, I might set up the free form handling offered by Netlify.\nSplit Testing A/B test blog posts? Yes!\nCDN/git LFS My blog contains a lot of images. I do my best to compress these images, but I will reach a point where the images are taking too much space, increasing the repo size. If Netlify\u0026rsquo;s solution is better, I might switch to that.\nToo Good to be Free? Netlify seems too good to be free. I\u0026rsquo;m on the free tier, and it appears to be generous.\n My 24 hour Netlify usagePetition to add a section that shows the carbon footprint on my blog builds. Take that, people flying on private jets!\n  But, it will only be some time until I pass these limits and would end up needing to pay for the service. It is not too much money but seeing that the alternative, GitHub Pages, is free, I cannot stop thinking, \u0026ldquo;maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t need deploy previews\u0026rdquo;.\nI hope I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write a post titled \u0026ldquo;How and Why I Migrated My Blog Back From Netlify to GitHub Pages\u0026rdquo;!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/","summary":"This blog is now deployed on Netlify.

I read it cover to cover in two sittings—it was a real page turner.\n Housel begins by talking about how people’s financial decisions are less mathematics, graphs and spreadsheets and are more influenced by their personal history, world view, ego, pride and odd incentives.\nHe drives this point throughout the book through 19 stories and teaches how you can make better financial decisions.\nThese are my notes—my key takeaways—on what each of these stories teach us.\n Everybody’s approach to money is different and is shaped by their own beliefs and experiences from different societies, cultures and economic conditions. The role of luck is often unaccounted. You can end up in the wrong side by making good financial decisions and vice versa. People at the top may have benefitted from luck while those at the bottom might have been the casualties of risk.  Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. To ease this risk, replicate broader patterns instead of trying to replicate specific individuals.   There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need. Your goals are never complete if you start comparing yourself with others. Keep your goalpost fixed. The role of time and compounding is important in building wealth. Ask Warren Buffet. Building wealth is easier compared to staying wealthy—it is a different game. Be optimistic that things will work out in the long term even while facing adversity in the short term. Raise your odds of success at a given level of risk. Failures are okay. Long list of failures are overcome by a small list of huge successes. Investment firms have huge portfolios and how many of them actually work out and make money? What wealth gives you is the control of time. This gives you control over doing what you want, when you want and with who you want. This is the most common variable that makes people happy. No one is impressed by your possessions as much as you are. People admire your possessions and not you. Trying to buy admiration and respect is a wild goose chase. Spending money to show you have money is the fastest way to loose money. Wealth is the money you don’t spend. It is what you don’t see. It is the ability to do/get things—time, freedom, possessions— in the future. You don’t need a reason to save money. You save money because you save money. With compounding, building wealth is more about savings rate than income (over a certain level of income). Investing strategies need not always be rational. Making reasonable choices like investing in your own country, investing in stocks you like and investing in family can give advantages. The best portfolio is the one that gives you peaceful sleep at night. Investing is not a hard science to work based on historical evidence. Investors are human and they are unpredictable.  Experiencing specific events doesn’t necessarily qualify you to know what would happen next. The events that greatly affected the economy could be outliers. Surprises are surprising.   Leave room for errors in your decision making. Think about what errors your can financially endure as well what you can emotionally endure. Your financial goals, your career goals, your life goals, change. Accounting for the unknown is hard and it is okay. The hidden price with investing is the ups and downs in the market, the uncertainty and the doubt in your mind. Be prepared to pay the price. Nothing is free. People are different and have different goals. Don’t be persuaded by the actions of people who are playing a different game than you. Understand your goals and your time horizon. Pessimism sounds smarter and people are drawn to its reasoning. But, the problems pessimists forecasts are solved by clever and novel solutions leading to optimistic futures.

Contributing to and maintaining documentation is not an easy task but is highly impactful.\nI will drop a bomb and say contributing to documentation is more important than contributing code.\nIn this post, I will try to share my insights on contributing to documentation from my experience as an open-source contributor and a maintainer.\n Being overwhelmed when you first start to contribute to open-source is natural. Start small. But start.\n Finding a Project The first thing to do before you can start contributing is finding a project you can contribute to. And the best project to contribute to is the one you have been using for a while.\nThat is, if you have been using a framework or a library, a tool or any other open-source project, contribute to it.\nWith this, you will have a lot of context on what the project is and you will definitely be able to find areas in the documentation you can improve.\nIf you cannot find such a project to contribute to, look for projects with an active community of contributors.\nCommunity is key in open-source and you will definitely reap the rewards for being part of a thriving community.\nAll these factors comes secondary to the fact that you should always contribute to projects that YOU are interested in.\nStart as a User As mentioned in the above section, you will be able to make impactful contributions if you are already a user of the project.\nSo, if you aren\u0026rsquo;t, you should start by exploring the project from the perspective of a user.\nAs a user, you will likely go through documentation and tutorials as you start out and you are likely to find bugs, out-dated content or things you can improve.\nWhen you find areas to improve, open up issues (or any form of tickets if you are not using GitHub) for these and discuss with a project maintainer to validate it and get it assigned to you.\nOnce you have been assigned an issue, you can start contributing.\nReview the Contributing Guidelines Most (if not all) open-source projects will have a contributing guideline in their GitHub/GitLab repository.\nThis document will be geared towards contributors with guidelines on setting up a developer environment and how you can make contributions.\nRead these guidelines carefully and make sure that you follow them.\nFor example, if a project requires you to sign every commit, your pull requests will be rejected very quickly if you do not do it.\nWhat should you Document? As mentioned in the previous sections, you are likely to find issues when you start to use the project referring to the documentation.\nThis could be as simple as an outdated screenshot to outdated or missing documentation.\nOpen up issues for these as mentioned and discuss it with a maintainer to get it assigned to you.\nIf you cannot find issues by yourself, you can try to fix already open issues.\nThere are labels in GitHub issues that can help you filer out only \u0026ldquo;documentation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;docs\u0026rdquo; issues and similar features will be there in any ticketing system being used by the project.\nIn-Code Documentation People generally don\u0026rsquo;t think of this when they think about documentation.\nIn-code documentation refers to the error messages, help texts and other text the user interacts with that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily affect the \u0026ldquo;logic\u0026rdquo; of the code.\nThese are really important as users will definitely interact with this while using the project.\nAs a new contributor you have the magic eyes to spot issues with these that seasoned contributors are too close to notice.\nMore Ways to go Beyond the Docs Page Good documentation is not just limited to the docs page.\nIt can also involve:\n Writing a blog post that takes the user through a new feature Creating a Twitter thread about the project Documenting processes that can be used for the community (a contributing guide for example) Updating the project\u0026rsquo;s website  You can always ask the project maintainers to help you find areas that need contributions.\nBefore we finish this, I want to point out that non-code open-source contributions are not just limited to writing documentation.\nYou can check out other ways you can contribute to open-source projects without contributing code .\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/contributing-to-documentation/","summary":"Contributing to documentation is really impactful for an open-source project. It can also be a stepping stone to make code contributions. Learn how.","title":"Contributing to Documentation in Open-Source"},{"content":"Contributing to open source is a great way to hone your skills while working on real world projects. But, for new developers, this process can seem daunting.\nAfter all, when you create a pull request, you are opening up your code for people to give feedback and criticize.\nThis is where open source mentorship programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) come in and bridge the gap between new developers and large open-source codebases.\nWhat is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)? GSoC is an annual program from Google focusing on bringing students and new developers into to open source.\nEach summer, participating mentees get to work on open source projects from the hundreds of organizations that participate in GSoC. The participating mentees are paired with mentors from the participating organizations and are also paid a stipend during their period of mentorship.\nHere is a quick summary of the program before we dive deep into the details.\n   Duration Timeline Stipend Eligibility     12 Weeks, ˜3 Months (Could be increased up to 22 weeks ) February 7th - November 28th  $1500 - $3300  Anyone about 18 years of age     Stick around till the end to learn more on how you can get selected and my tips as a GSoC mentor.\n This year, GSoC is open to everyone above the age of 18 and not just students.\n Why Should I Participate in GSoC? According to Linux Foundation\u0026#39;s 2021 Open Source Jobs Report , 92% of employers say finding people with open source skills is difficult.\nOpen source skills are in demand and there is definitely a lack of supply.\nParticipating in programs like GSoC helps you:\n Gain real world experience Build your network Boost your career Get a stable stipend  The goal of GSoC is to enable mentees to be good open source stewards. Successfully completing GSoC can open doors for you and could even lead to a career in open source .\nAm I Eligible to Participate? With the new rules for 2022 , everyone over the age of 18 is eligible to participate.\nYou should also have a strong desire to contribute to open source and help the community of course!\nWhen does GSoC Start? Organizations start applying from February 7th.\nMentees can start applying from April 4th till April 19th.\nSee the 2022 timeline for GSoC for other details.\nHow Long is the Program? This time around, mentors and mentees can extend the period of GSoC up to 22 weeks instead of the mandatory 12 weeks as in previous years.\nSee the dates of each program milestones for a better idea on the timeline.\nHow do I Apply? You can apply on the GSoC website when the application period starts.\nThe application process is mainly these 3 steps:\n Selecting an organization Selecting a project Preparing a project proposal  How do I Select an Organization? GSoC has hundreds of participating organizations each year. Mentees can apply to any of these organizations, but filtering through them and deciding which to contribute to can be difficult without a proper plan.\nSo, to be in the best position when the application process starts, you have to be prepared.\nYou can find organizations to contribute to even before they are officially announced. I would suggest following the steps below.\n Write down what skills/ tech stack you know currently Write down the skills/ tech stack you want to learn Filter organizations based on these two criteria Look through the projects in the organization to find what interests you List down multiple projects across organizations that fit this criteria  How do I Select a Project? You would have now narrowed down to a couple of projects under the same or different organizations. How do you go from here? How do you know which project to submit a proposal to?\nThe key here is homework. You need to learn more about the projects.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I suggest doing:\n Start by using the project and see how it works (Is it cool?) Go through the project\u0026rsquo;s documentation and contributing guidelines (Are there well documented processes?) Join the project\u0026rsquo;s community channel (Slack, Discord, mailing lists) (Are they active and welcoming?) Pick up a \u0026ldquo;good first issue\u0026rdquo; and try to fix it (Is it doable? Do you get support from the mentors/maintainers?) Ask clarifying questions about the project on the communication channels (Do you get answers?)  If the answer to all these questions is a solid \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;, then you need to ask yourself the golden question.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I want to contribute to this project?\u0026rdquo;.\nYou know what to do next.\nHow do I Submit a Proposal? Now that you have a project(s) chosen, it is time for the biggest step yet. Submitting a proposal.\nLike other open source mentorship programs, GSoC can also get competitive. You have to make your proposal stand out to get accepted.\nGSoC\u0026rsquo;s official guides outline what is expected in a proposal and also shows some examples of good proposals .\nIt is important that you communicate with your potential mentors prior to submitting a proposal to make sure that you have the right idea. Clarify the deliverables and establish a realistic deadline before you start writing the proposal.\nIf you already have prior contributions before you submit the proposal, it would definitely put your application in front.\nHow will I Get Selected? Once you submit the proposal, the mentors will go through each submission and will let you know if you get selected or not.\nIf you get selected, it\u0026rsquo;s time to celebrate!\nWhat if I don\u0026rsquo;t get Selected? Don\u0026rsquo;t stop contributing!\nGSoC is highly competitive and it is difficult to get selected. But you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a GSoC mentee to contribute to open source. You can do it independently!\nThe spirit of GSoC is open source and open collaboration. If you keep contributing, you will learn a lot and will have a head start for the next year\u0026rsquo;s program.\nIf your project participates in any other open source internship programs , you can apply for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m in GSoC! The first three weeks of the program will be a community bonding period. You can use this time to get a feel of the community before you start engaging.\nYou will get to code in the next weeks. A part of the stipend will be provided once you complete one of the two evaluations.\nAnd as mentioned before, the timeline for 2022 is pretty flexible.\nEnding Notes I personally believe GSoC is a great program. It has and will continue to help attract students and new developers to work in open source.\nThe goal for this program is to not make some money (money is important) but to foster open source software.\nThe impact such programs have on the community is incredible. And as GSoC mentees, you inherit the responsibility to pay it forward.\nSo, don\u0026rsquo;t stop contributing after GSoC ends. Be a mentor next time. Help others in the community.\nBest of luck on your GSoC application!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/everything-about-gsoc/","summary":"Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a great way to start contributing to open source while getting paid to do so. This article dives deep into everything GSoC from the application procedure to tips from real experience on being successful","title":"Everything you Need to Know About Google Summer of Code (GSoC): Important Dates, Eligibility, Application, Getting Selected and Other Tips"},{"content":"With Hacktoberfest around the corner, here are some tips to make better Pull Requests for your next Open-Source contribution.\n As a maintainer and a contributor to Open-Source projects these are the things I look for when reviewing and take care of when submitting Pull Requests.\n This is a fast read but if you want one even faster, check out this Twitter thread .\nTip 1: Contributing Docs are your Best Friends Most Open-Source projects have a contributing doc(usually a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root of the repo) that contains all the necessary details on how to set up your development environment, coding conventions you have to follow and much more.\nIf you are looking to contribute to a project, that should be the next place to look into after the ReadME file.\nContributing doc from the Meshery project\nTip 2: Document Your PRs This is really important. I repeat this is really important.\nYou should make the reviewing process as easy as possible and a reviewer should be able to get the context of your PR with a quick glance.\nFor this, you can:\n Write self-documenting code (What is self-documenting code and how can it help? See this great answer ) Use comments liberally in your code Write clear commit messages and Most importantly, comment what your PR does clearly  As shown below, the PR description shows what issue it fixes, the change made in the PR and the actual new User-Experience.\nThis makes the PR very easy to review.\nA Pull Request description example\nTip 3: Use Pull Request Templates Most Open-Source projects will have a Pull Request template to guide newcomers and veterans alike into documenting their PRs properly.\nAs you can see below, the PR template has sections where the contributors are expected to fill details.\nPull Request template from the Open Service Mesh project\nThis would make the job of the reviewer much easier as they would be able to easily test it out, ask a domain expert to review and much more.\nThese also acts like a checklist that the contributor can tick off. For example: Questions like \u0026ldquo;Did I write unit tests?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Did I sign all of my commits?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Is this a breaking change?\u0026quot; can be answered as you start filling the template.\nTip 4: Make your PRs Small and Focused Whenever possible, your Pull Requests should do one thing and one thing only.\nThe problem with addressing multiple concerns in a single PR is that the reviewer may not agree with all the changes and this could potentially lead to long discussions.\nSo small and focused PRs would reduce the time taken for reviews and would make your PR most likely to get merged.\nAn Example Pull Request with just a single, focused change\nTip 5: Add Tests If the project you are working on has automated tests, then make sure that you add tests for the code you are adding.\nNot sure if you should write tests? Here is a bonus tip:\n If it can be tested, it should be tested.\n Tip 6: Make sure the Automated Tests Pass Most projects have automated tests in their CI/CD pipelines which run on your Pull Requests.\nThese tests are in place to make sure that the code you are adding passes some constraints. These are mostly lint checks, build checks, unit tests and integration tests.\nIf these checks are not passing, fix it and make sure all the tests pass before asking for a review.\nYour code is not likely to get merged if these checks fail.\nAll checks passed!\nTip 7: Respond to Feedback When you open a Pull Request, you are also opening a discussion on why this change is needed and why your PR is the right way to add that change.\nSo, make sure that you respond to reviews, make changes to your PR as suggested by the reviewer and ask for clarification questions if needed.\nThis would make sure that you and the reviewer are on the same page and would make the PR reviews much easier.\nSometimes discussions can get really long! But these are necessary when you are adding a new feature with breaking changes\nTip 8: Be Patient Most of the Open-Source maintainers are volunteers. They maintain projects during their free time off from their work.\nSo, they may take some time to get to your PR and review it.\nSo be patient while they do their thing. Take a break, drink a cup of coffee and watch Naruto.\nBonus Tip: I will be writing about Contributing to, Building, Scaling and Maintaining Open-Source projects here on my blog as well as on Twitter and on the DEV Community .\nIn this last year, I have went from a noob Open-Source contributor to:\n Building my own project and making it to the #1 Trending Repository on GitHub  Maintaining 2 CNCF Projects and Working full-time in Open-Source  I would like to share everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to help as many people as possible who are interested in Open-Source.\nSo, follow along and may the source be with you!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/pull-requests-like-a-pro/","summary":"Tips to make High-Quality Pull Requests.","title":"Pull Requests Like a PRO"},{"content":"Contributing to open-source is one of the best ways to gain skills and build your resume as a student or as a new developer.\nAs open-source becomes the norm, more and more big tech companies and non-profit organizations have been investing into open-source projects and into internship programs.\nThese programs often offer the intern a mentorship opportunity and a stable stipend so that they can invest their time to work on these projects.\nThis post consists of all the details of these programs.

(absolutely not clickbait).\nYou have just created this awesome project and you shared it on GitHub. You think now you’ll just sit back and wait for the world to tell you how cool your project is. After all, you have worked tirelessly for the past month on this very challenging project, right?\nWell, let’s just take a step back and look from the perspective of a developer or a user checking your project. Although you know how cool your project is, and how it is going to solve that one pressing problem that hasn’t been fixed(until you came along), the person would be looking at your project and wondering what in the world you have built.\nIf nobody can’t figure out how to use your software, there’s something very bad going on.\n  Photo from imgflip\n  If people don’t know what your software does, then they won’t use it or contribute to it and they will most likely find something more clear and concise in the sea of open-source software.\nThat’s where the README comes in!\nA good README is like the face of your project. It is the first thing a person looks at in your project and it gives them a very brief introduction to your software.\n  Beginning of the README from my NSFW Filter project\n  A good-looking and helpful README file can make your project stand out and grab attention from the developer community.\nIt will help them understand your project, how they can get it working and why they should contribute.\n “Wow, man! Nice rant there! If you know so much about stuff why don’t you tell us how to write then…”\n Hey, I can’t tell you that there is a concrete set of rules and you should follow those rules without swaying for a good README.\nIt doesn’t work like that.\nI will share how I write a README for my Open-Source projects and things that you should consider while you write one for your projects and you will(hopefully) be able to get some insights.\nAlso, remember that you won’t be the README master in a day. Like all things, it takes practice.\nI have been contributing to open-source for a while now and a thing I noticed is that all great projects have an Awesome README.\nYou are on the project page and within minutes you are up and running with your version of the project.\nThere are a lot of contributors, a lot of pull requests, updated versions being released frequently and they all have the common factor of an awesome README.\nA new developer will be able to find all the details to get started like install instructions and contributing guides.\nA new user would be able to find how the project is being used with informative screenshots and demos.\n “I don’t have time for this, show me the README already!”\n Alright, alright, alright (sorry I went a little McConaughey ).\nHere is the README file for my project \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;NSFW\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Filter\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; . I think this is the best README that I have written.\nI will go through the different parts of the README that I think are essential to every README.\n Here is the link for the README file used in this example. You can also find a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;template\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; README file that you can directly copy and paste in your projects.\nWell, that winds things up.\nI bid you farewell my grasshopper with these parting words(of wisdom) from the README Sensei(new twitter handle alert!).\n  Photo from imgflip\n  ","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-to-write-an-awesome-readme/","summary":"A comprehensive guide to writing README that stands out and makes people go WOW!","title":"How to write an Awesome README"}]
